# Global Energy Consumption Forecasting

This project analyzes global energy production and consumption data and builds predictive models to forecast future trends.

Machine learning models used:
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Prophet (Facebook's open-source forecasting tool)

The project compares the performance of ARIMA and Prophet models and visualizes the results.

## Dataset
- Energy Institute's Statistical Review dataset
- Data format: CSV (Panel format)

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express
- Prophet
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Make sure the dataset `Panel format.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook `global-energy-prediction.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Project Goal
To predict global energy production and consumption patterns using machine learning time series models and evaluate their performance.
